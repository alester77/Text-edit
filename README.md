# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description
This project is a fully functional text editor web application, designed to streamline and enhance the user experience in writing and editing text. The motivation behind this project was to create a robust and efficient text editing tool that leverages modern web technologies. This application addresses the need for a lightweight, yet powerful text editor that can be used across various platforms. Throughout this project, I've gained significant insights into client-server architecture, modern JavaScript practices, and the deployment of web applications.
